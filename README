Read and write tiddlers, bags, and recipes to a package's resources.

For now the store is a slightly modified version of the text store.
The store_root is set as a resource_filename.

This is a fundamental building block for improving instancer.
As store can be set as read only, or read write. A developer
would build a package's resources by using a store that can be
written to, while an instance script or 'twanager update' would
use a read only store.

Currently considered experimental, so not releasing to PyPI.
