Read and write tiddlers and related to a package resources.

For now, simply based on the text store.

The basic ideas are:

* Put a store_root in package resources
* Write tiddlers, bags and recipes there.
* Later allow them to be read from there when:
  * `twanager update` runs, updating an instance
  * If diststore is being used, let some bags "live" in the package.

There are a few different goals to be satisfied here:

Replace at least some parts of twp.twimport and twp.instancer and the
bizarre fact that the 'update' command is in tiddlywebwiki with a
concerted whole that makes some measure of sense.

That functionality is:

* For a developer make it easy to get resources into a package
  in a structured way (what './cacher' does in many plugins).
* Make instance commands (like twinstance and tiddlyspace) easy to
  create and use.
* Have a 'twanager update' that is more clever.
